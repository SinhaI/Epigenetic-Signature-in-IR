In this repository we have added the code used to generate the circos plot in this article. The circos plot was selected by the Journal as its cover page during its publication.

Chromosomal position of 223 Insuline resistance (IR) associated genes containing a total of 336 Differencially methylated regions (DMS) are shown in the figure. Inner circle shows gene expression data (blue, upregulated expression in IR; yellow, downregulated expression in IR), outer circle represents methylation data (blue, high methylation in IR; yellow, low methylation in IR)
