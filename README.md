In this repository we have added the code used to generate the circos plot for this article. The circos plot was selected by the Journal as its cover page image during its publication.

**Description of the circus plot:** Chromosomal position of 223 Insuline resistance (IR) associated genes containing a total of 336 Differencially methylated regions (DMS) are shown in the figure. Inner circle shows gene expression data (blue, upregulated expression in IR; yellow, downregulated expression in IR), outer circle represents methylation data (blue, high methylation in IR; yellow, low methylation in IR)

**To run this code DOWNLOAD CIRCOS, TUTORIALS AND TOOLS from http://circos.ca/software/download/circos/**

To run Circos, you need Perl. 
To run Circos, you'll need to invoke perl and pass the Circos script as an argument, along with any command-line parameters

C:>perl C:\path\to\circos\bin\circos [any command-line parameters]
